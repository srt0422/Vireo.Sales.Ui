### "The greater the obstacle, the more glory in overcoming it." - *Moli&egrave;re*
When my friends started graduating from college, I got the sinking feeling that the experts haven't been wholly honest with us about the state of the economy.  When my friends with college degrees were unable to find entry level jobs in their fields I thought maybe we aren't thriving the way I hear the TV talking heads say.  When they all seemed to live at home far longer than any of us hoped for when, as kids, we dreamed for that far away land our parents called "growing up", I became a little cynical.  

I got lucky.  I was able to acquir some marketable skills, and after a few years of really really hard work, my family and I are thriving.  Still I hear about a lot of people struggling to get a raise, or find a job just to afford a living.  I find that everyone who followed the basic steps to prosperity (high school, college, successful career) have been failed by our system and its promises.  Further more, businesses seem to struggle to keep their doors open.

So  I wasn't surprised to find a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics <sup id="source_ref1">[1](#source1)</sup>, telling the story of more and more people opting out of the job market all together.  I wasn't surprised to find an article from the heritage foundation <sup id="source_ref1">[2](#source2)</sup> pointing out that, despite what Obama, or Trump led us to believe, our economy will prove a disappointment in the days of 2017 onward.

Lots of obstacles face businesses and individuals right now.  We have a stagnant economy, with low wage and productivity growth, with high urban costs of living and decreasing labor force participation.

When people have less to spend, how do you grow your business?  Expand your strategies for connecting to current and potential customers.  Make sure that less people are falling under your radar.

In the coming weeks, we will explore several strategies to help businesses and individuals overcome growing economic obstacles.  We'll introduce technologies, and techniques that will help you without breaking the bank.
Our current planned topics include 

1.	Build an app - It's not as expensive as you think, and it's more effective than you'd guess. ([see an example](https://apptivator.cloudvireo.com/index.html?source=link))
2.	Get your app found in the app store - Make apple and android work for you with app store optimization.
3.  Build your social media presence - Now you can use the same tools as the big leagues.
4.	Start a blog - Talk to your customers on a regular basis.
