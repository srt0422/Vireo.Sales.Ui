A professor at Case Western Reserve University<sup id="source_ref1">[1](#source1)</sup> says that small businesses are benefiting from the power of mobile.  I'll give you 3 reasons why he's right.

1. Your customers use their smartphones even more than ever.
2. Mobile apps give you a unique ability to engage with your customers.
3. You can have a custom business app with greater ease and a lower price than ever before.

## Your customers use their smartphones more than ever

According to Gallop<sup id="source_ref2">[2](#source2)</sup> the average smartphone user checks their smartphone at least once every hour, but most check more often.

- The average consumer spends more that 198 minutes per day in mobile apps (compared to 168 minutes on TV)<sup id="source_ref3">[3](#source3)</sup>
- Mobile apps account for most of the time that consumers spend researching products and services.
- Over 90% of product searches from a mobile device result in a sale<sup id="source_ref4">[4](#source4)</sup>.

## Mobile apps put your business in the pockets of your customers

- Push notifications provide a unique opportunity to lead your customers to buy your products or services. 
- With 50% of mobile consumers wanting to take action within the hour (83% within the day)<sup id="source_ref4">[4](#source4)</sup> you can capture their business with a simple contact form.

## Easy and inexpensive - only 100$.
- Vireo offers mobile app development services, and right now you can get a mobile IOS app for only $100<sup id="source_ref5">[5](#source5)</sup> customized for your business.
